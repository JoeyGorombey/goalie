# 📅 Milestone Sorting & Enhanced Status Feature

## 📋 Overview
Milestones are now automatically sorted by due date, and goals have enhanced status tracking to show when they're "Behind", "Late", or both! Overdue milestones are visually flagged, making it easy to see what needs attention.

---

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. **Automatic Milestone Sorting** 📊
- **Milestones with dates come first**, sorted chronologically
- **Undated milestones appear last**
- **Visual note**: "(sorted by due date)" appears in header
- **Maintains drag-and-drop** functionality

### 2. **Enhanced Goal Status System** 🎯

Goals can now show these statuses:

#### **🎯 On Track** (Purple)
- All milestones on schedule
- Goal not overdue
- Everything looking good!

#### **⏰ Behind Schedule** (Orange - Pulsing)
- One or more milestones past their due date
- Goal itself not overdue yet
- Needs attention!

#### **⚠️ Late** (Pink - Pulsing)
- Goal's overall due date has passed
- But all milestones are on schedule
- Goal deadline needs extension

#### **🚨 Late & Behind** (Dark Red - Fast Pulse!)
- **Most urgent!**
- Goal is overdue
- AND has overdue milestones
- Needs immediate action!

#### **✅ Completed** (Green)
- All milestones done
- Celebration time!

### 3. **Visual Overdue Indicators** ⚠️

**Overdue Milestones Get:**
- ⚠️ **Warning emoji** next to text
- **Red left border** (4px)
- **Pink background** (#fff5f5)
- **"Overdue:"** label instead of "Due by"
- **Red date text** (#f5576c)

**Non-Overdue Milestones:**
- Clean appearance
- Purple due date text
- Standard background

## 🎨 Visual Design

### **Status Badge Colors:**

| Status | Gradient | Emoji | Animation |
|--------|----------|-------|-----------|
| On Track | Purple (667eea → 764ba2) | 🎯 | None |
| Behind | Orange (ffa726 → fb8c00) | ⏰ | Slow pulse (2s) |
| Late | Pink (f093fb → f5576c) | ⚠️ | Slow pulse (2s) |
| Late & Behind | Dark Red (d32f2f → c62828) | 🚨 | Fast pulse (1.5s) |
| Completed | Green (11998e → 38ef7d) | ✅ | None |

### **Overdue Milestone Styling:**

## 🔍 Status Detection Logic

### **Behind Schedule Detection:**
```javascript
// Check if ANY incomplete milestone is past its due date
const isBehind = milestones.some(m => 
  m.dueDate && 
  !m.completed && 
  new Date(m.dueDate) < today
)
```

### **Late Detection:**
```javascript
// Check if goal's overall due date has passed
const isLate = 
  goal.dueDate && 
  new Date(goal.dueDate) < today
```

### **Priority Order:**
1. Check if completed → **Completed** ✅
2. Check if late AND behind → **Late & Behind** 🚨
3. Check if late → **Late** ⚠️
4. Check if behind → **Behind** ⏰
5. Otherwise → **On Track** 🎯

---

## 🎯 Milestone Sorting Algorithm

```javascript
// 1. Split milestones into two groups
const withDates = milestones.filter(m => m.dueDate)
const withoutDates = milestones.filter(m => !m.dueDate)

// 2. Sort dated milestones chronologically
withDates.sort((a, b) => new Date(a.dueDate) - new Date(b.dueDate))

// 3. Concatenate: dated first, undated last
return [...withDates, ...withoutDates]
```

**Result:** Dates in order, then all undated milestones

## 🚫 Known Limitations

### **"Abandoned" Status**
Currently not implemented. Awaiting user clarification on trigger conditions:
- Option A: No activity for X days?
- Option B: Very overdue (30+ days)?
- Option C: Manual marking?
- Option D: All milestones incomplete + way past due?

### **Manual Milestone Reordering**
- Drag-and-drop still works
- But milestones resort on page reload
- Date-based sorting takes precedence

---

- 📊 **Status history** - Track when goals went behind/late
- 🔧 **"Abandoned" status** - Once logic is defined
