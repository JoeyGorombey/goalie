# 🎯 Goal Status Feature

## 📋 Overview
Goals now have status tracking! Goals can be **Active**, **Overdue**, or **Completed**. When all milestones reach 100% completion, the goal is automatically marked as completed before displaying the congratulations widget.

---

## ✨ Features Implemented

### 1. **Database Schema Update** 🗄️
- Added `status` column to `goals` table
- Default value: `'active'`
- Allowed values: `'active'`, `'completed'`
- Database-level constraint ensures valid values

### 2. **Automatic Migration** 🔄
- Created migration script: `server/db/add-status-migration.js`
- Safely adds status column to existing databases
- Sets all existing goals to `'active'` status
- Can be run multiple times without errors

### 3. **Smart Status Detection** 🧠
Goals display different statuses based on:

**✅ Completed:**
- Goal status is explicitly set to `'completed'`
- Happens automatically when 100% of milestones are done
- Green gradient badge

**⚠️ Overdue:**
- Goal has a due date
- Due date is in the past
- Goal is not completed
- Red gradient badge with pulsing animation

**🎯 Active:**
- Goal is in progress
- Not overdue, not completed
- Purple gradient badge

### 4. **Backend API Endpoint** 📡

**New Endpoint:**
```
POST /api/goals/:id/complete
```

**Purpose:** Mark a goal as completed when 100% progress is reached

**Response:** Returns updated goal with `status: 'completed'`

**Swagger Documentation:** Automatically updated ✅

### 5. **Frontend Integration** ⚛️

**Automatic Completion Flow:**
1. User checks last remaining milestone
2. Progress reaches 100%
3. Frontend calls `/api/goals/:id/complete` endpoint
4. Goal status updated to `'completed'` in database
5. 🎉 Congratulations modal appears!

**Status Display:**
- Status badges on **Goal Cards** (My Goals page)
- Status badge on **Goal Details** page
- Dynamic colors based on status
- Emoji indicators for quick recognition
- Hover effects for interactivity

### 6. **Visual Design** 🎨

**Status Badges:**
- **Active** → Purple gradient (667eea → 764ba2) with 🎯
- **Overdue** → Pink/Red gradient (f093fb → f5576c) with ⚠️ + pulse animation
- **Completed** → Green gradient (11998e → 38ef7d) with ✅

**Styling Features:**
- Smooth gradients
- Rounded corners
- Shadow effects
- Hover lift animation
- Pulsing animation for overdue goals
